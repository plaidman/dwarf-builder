[color=yellow][size=14pt][b]Description[/b][/size][/color]:
This mac app will guide you through Dwarf Fortress configuration options and allow you to "[i]roll your own[/i]" native mac app for Dwarf Fortress featuring the config options and tileset you chose. No need to deal with copying folders or editing init files. Basically it's an app which creates your very own customized Dwarf Fortress app. Easy Peasy!

[color=yellow][size=14pt][b]How To Use It[/b][/size][/color]:
This mod will open a terminal window and present a menu for the various config option categories. Press the number or letter corresponding to the options. Some options will toggle between yes/no, some options will prompt for input, and some will cycle through several predefined values. When you're comfortable with the options, go back to the main menu and choose 'construct'. The script will apply the settings and create a shiny new customized DwarfFortress.app in the same directory as the DwarfBuilder.app.

Dwarf Therapist can also be installed and updated from this package (on the main menu).
